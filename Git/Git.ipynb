    "\n",
    "### git status\n",
    "- Git has a staging area in which it stores files with changes you want to save that haven't saved yet\n",
    "- `git status` show you which files are in the staging area, and which files have changes that haven't yet been put there\n",
    "\n",
    "### git diff\n",
    "- Helps compare the previous version vs. the current file/directory\n",
    "- Commands :\n",
    "    - `git diff` : show you all the changes in your repository\n",
    "    - `git diff filename/directory` : show you changes in the file/directory\n",
    "    - `git diff -r HEAD path/to/file` : Compare the state of your files with those in the staging area. `-r` means \"compare to a previous version\", and `HEAD` means \"the most recent commit\". \n",
    "    Path to the file is relative to where you are\n",
    "    \n",
    "### git diff ID1..ID2\n",
    "- `git show` with a commit ID shows the changes made in a particular commit. To see the changes between two commits, you can use `git diff ID1..ID2`\n",
    "    - `ID1` and `ID2` identify the two commits you're interested in\n",
    "    - `..` the connector is a pair of dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### git commit \n",
    "- `git commit --amend -m \"new message\"` : Change a commit message\n",
    "\n",
    "### git log\n",

    "## How does Git work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 Level Structure\n",
    "1. Commit\n",
    ": Contains metadata such as the author, the commit message, and the time the commit happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tree\n",
    ": Each commit also has a tree, which tracks the names and locations in the repository when that commit happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Blob (\"Binary Large Object\")\n",
    ": For each of the files listed in the tree, there is a blob. This contains a compressed snapshot of the contents of the file when the commit happened. Binary large object (blob) is a SQL database term for \"may contain data of any kind\". \n",
    "  - For files that didn't change, the tree links to the blob from a previous commit where changes did happen for them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hash\n",
    "- Every commit has a unique identifier called a hash since it is generated by running the changes through a pseudo-random number generator called a hash function.\n",
    "- Hash is normally written as a 40 character hexadecimal string.\n",
    "- Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories.\n",
    "  - If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same.\n",
    "  - Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well.\n",
    "- Git can therefore tell what information needs to be saved where by comparing hashes rather than comparing entire files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### git show\n",
    "- To view the details of a specific commit, you use the command `git show` with the first few characters of the commit's hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HEAD\n",
    "- A hash is liken an absolute path:\n",
    "it identifies a specific commit.\n",
    "  - Another way to identify a commit is to use the equivalent of a relative path.\n",
    "- Head : refers to the most recent commit\n",
    "  - `HEAD~1` refers to the commit before it\n",
    "\n",
    "### git annotate file\n",
    "- Gives more detailed history of a file than `git log`\n",
    "- Each line contains five elements (with elements two to four enclosed in parentheses). When inspecting the first line, we see:\n",
    "  - The first eight digits of the hash\n",
    "  - The author\n",
    "  - The time of the commit\n",
    "  - The line number\n",
    "  - The contents of the line"
