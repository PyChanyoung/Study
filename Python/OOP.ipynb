    "# What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object = State(e.g. name, email) + behavior (e.g. function)\n",
    "The disticntive feature of OOP is that state and behavior are bundled together: instead of thinking of cunstomer data separately from customer actions, we think of them as one unit representing a customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is called encapsulation, and it's one of the core tenets of object-oriented-programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation - bundling data with code operating on it**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes as blueprints\n",
    "- Class: blueprint for objects outlining possible states and behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects = attributes + methods\n",
    "- State: attribute <-> **variables** <-> `obj.my_addribute`, (Attributes encode the state of an object and are represented by variables.)\n",
    "- Behavior: method <-> **function()** <-> `obj.my_method()`.\n",
    "- `dir(instance)` : lists all attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring object interface\n",
    "- type() :\n",
    "- dir() : \n",
    "- `help(x)` : calling `help()` in the console will show the documentation for the object or class `x`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class anatomy: attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is self?\n",
    "- classes are templates, how to refer data of a particular object?\n",
    "- `self` is a stand-in for a particular object(=instance) used in class definition\n",
    "- should be the first argument of any method\n",
    "- Python will take care of `self` when method called from an object:\n",
    "`cust.identify(\"Laura\")` *will be interpreted as* `Customer.identify(cust, \"Laura\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class anatomy: the __init__ constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructor\n",
    "- **Constructor** `__init__()` method is called every time an object is created.\n",
    "- If I have a class `Foo` then:\n",
    "    - `Foo()` is the **constructor**\n",
    "    - `Foo.__new__()` is the **allocator**\n",
    "    - `Foo.__init__()` is the **initializer**\n",
    "\n",
    "어떤 프로그래밍 언어이던간에, Constructor는 항상 Object가 메모리에 자리를 잡은 다음에 실행이 된다. 따라서 Python만 Constructor가 아닌 Initializer라고 할 필요는 없다. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Best practices\n",
    "1. **Initialize attributes in** `__init__()`\n",
    "2. **Naming**\n",
    "`CamelCase` for class, `lower_snake_case` for functions and attributes\n",
    "3. `self` **is** `self`\n",
    "4. **Use docstrings**\n",

    "- minimal/maximal values for attributes\n",
    "- commonly used values and constants, e.g. `pi` for a `Circle` class\n",
    "- ...\n",

    "Even though `MAX_SPEED` is shared across instances, assigning 7 to `p1.MAX_SPEED` didn't change the value of `MAX_SPEED` in `p2`, or in the `Player` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "So What happend? In fact, Python created a new *instance attribute* in `p1`, also called it `MAX_SPEED`, and assigned `7` to it, without touching the class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "If want to touch class variable, have to use that `className.classAttribute` format.\n",
